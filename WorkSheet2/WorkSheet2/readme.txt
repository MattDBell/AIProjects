GP3321 - Artificial Intelligence - Winter 2012
Tremors Scenario

Problem Set 2, Problem 5, 70 points
The following files should be included:
    main.cpp
    Matrix.h
    Matrix.cpp
    Monster.h
    Monster.cpp
    Makefile (for Linux or Mac programmers)

Minimal edits need be done in main.cpp; if you want to play the game normally, uncomment the function Reveal(). If you want to show the probability distribution as it is set now (nothing is set except for the monster's starting point) uncomment the function Print(). Most of your programming should focus on the function inside of Matrix::ProbabilityUpdate(). Given the monster's initial position, you should be able to estimate where the monster is at t=1. You should be able to use your information at t=1 to determine t=2, t=2 for t=3, and so on.
